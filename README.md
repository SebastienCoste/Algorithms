1. Maxflow - Mincut :  

Some java class to find the maxflow of a problem: 
 - [Evacuation](src/week1/Evacuation.java): compute the flow from a source to a destination. The most generic implementation.
 - [AirlineCrews](src/week1/AirlineCrews.java): compute the affectation of a list of crews to a list of flight. This is optimized for a problem with each flow with a size of 1. 
 - [StockCharts](src/week1/StockCharts.java): TODO: use somehow the Ford-Fulkerson algo to solve the number of charts needed to show stocks.
