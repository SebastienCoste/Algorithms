### Maxflow - Mincut Problem:  

Some java class to find the maxflow of a problem: 
 - [Evacuation](src/week1/Evacuation.java): compute the flow from a source to a destination. The most generic implementation.
 - [AirlineCrews](src/week1/AirlineCrews.java): compute the affectation of a list of crews to a list of flight. This is optimized for a problem with each flow with a size of 1. 
 - [StockCharts](src/week1/StockCharts.java): TODO: use somehow the Ford-Fulkerson algo to solve the number of charts needed to show stocks.  
 
  See [Maxflow-Mincut.pdf](src/resources/Maxflow-Mincut.pdf)
  
  
### Linear Problems:

Some java class to solve linear equalities and inequalities
  - [EnergyValues](src/week2/EnergyValues.java): Solving n linear equalities of n variables using gaussian elimination
  - [Diet](src/week2/Diet.java): Solving n linear inequalities of m<n variables, inspirated from [Simplex](src/fr/sttc/problems/linear/Simplex.java)
